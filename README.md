# 32-bit Multitasking Operating System
This is a simple 32-bit multitasking operating system based on Linux 0.11. The operating system includes a bootloader, kernel, and applications, and implements simple design of kernel modules including logging, interrupt management, process management, process synchronization and mutual exclusion, storage management, system calls, device management, and file system.

## Main Tasks
Designing the bootloader, kernel, and applications
Implementing simple design of kernel modules including logging, interrupt management, process management, process synchronization and mutual exclusion, storage management, system calls, device management, and file system
Implementing a command-line interface including simple applications
Accomplishments
The operating system provides multiple window interaction, shell command execution, and loading of disk applications.
